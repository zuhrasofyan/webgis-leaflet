# angular-passport
Angular boilerplate front-end with passport to connect to REST API. Created using fountainjs.


## Fountainjs generator workflow:
* Javascript framework: Angular 1.*
* Module Management: None with Bower and script injection
* Js Preprocessor: Pure old Javascript
* CSS Preprocessor: SASS
* Continues Integration Platform: None
* Sample App: Landing Page

## Key Functionality:
* Angular 1.6
* Automatic script injection
* Gulp
* Bootstrap SASS + glyphicons integration out of the box
* Authentification with passportjs
* Token and authenticated user data saved in local storage
* 

## HOW TO 
* Copy or download repo to your favourite folder
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* `gulp serve` to serve from tmp folder
* `gulp build` to build production ready files (dist folder)

### ATTENTION!
MIT License.
For best experience to test all functionality, a (REST API) server with passport-type authentification is needed. This work aimed to quickly setup a front-end application with access to REST API + authentification using passport.
Works best if you combined it with my REST API [sails-passport](https://github.com/zuhrasofyan/sails-passport).
